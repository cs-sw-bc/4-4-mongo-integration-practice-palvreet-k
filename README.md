# 🛠️ Assignment: Full CRUD Inventory App

## 🎯 Objective

Build a complete inventory management system with **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete (CRUD)** functionality using the lesson materials as your base.

---

## 1. Setup

- Create a **new MongoDB database**.
- Create a collection named **`inventory`**.
- Upload the provided `inventory.json` file into the collection.

---

## 2. Implement Create and Update

- Your task is to write the necessary **controller logic and Express routes** to make these pages functional.
- You can follow the exact same steps from our class today to achieve this step.

---

## 3. Add Delete Functionality (Build It Yourself)

### ❗ Why this step matters:
Unlike Create and Update, **you were not given a delete page**. This is intentional. This step is meant to test your ability to:
- Create a **new page from scratch**.
- Wire it to a **new route**.
- Write the **controller logic** to delete items from the database.

### 🔧 Your task:
- Build a **Delete Page** (HTML + EJS) that allows the user to pick an item to delete.
- Implement the corresponding **route and controller** for deleting an item from the inventory.

---

## ✅ Final Deliverable

Your completed app should allow a user to:

- **Create** inventory items (with the given page + your logic)
- **View** all items
- **Update** existing items (with the given page + your logic)
- **Delete** items (your own page + route + logic)
